        Ado WORLD TOUR 2025 “Hibana” Powered by Crunchyroll in Manila.
        Crunchyroll, the global brand for anime, has announced today that iconic Japanese vocalist Ado will embark on her second world tour, Ado WORLD TOUR 2025 “Hibana” Powered by Crunchyroll, reaching even more fans worldwide next year.
        Ado WORLD TOUR 2025 “Hibana” Powered by Crunchyroll is gearing up to be one of the biggest world tours ever organized by a Japanese artist, a strong follow-up to her first-ever, sold-out world tour this year, “Wish” Powered by Crunchyroll. Starting at Tokyo’s iconic Saitama Super Arena next April, Ado will light up over 30 cities worldwide before closing out in Honolulu, Hawaii next August.
        The tour will feature six stops in Asia—Bangkok, Manila, Taoyuan, Seoul, Hong Kong, and Singapore—after kicking off in Saitama. It will also include two Australian stops in Sydney and Melbourne.
        Promoted by AEG Presents Asia and Ovation Productions, Ado WORLD TOUR 2025 “Hibana”, Powered by Crunchyroll in Manila can be purchased through SM Tickets. A presale for Crunchyroll fans will begin at 10AM PHT on Tuesday, November 19, 2024. The presale code will be available on Crunchyroll News. General ticket sales will open on Friday, November 22, 2024, at 10AM PHT.“If my first world tour embodied my ‘Wish,’ then my second will ignite the spark I want to light in the world,” said Ado. “I named this tour ‘Hibana,’ meaning ‘spark’ in Japanese, to carry my heritage with me on this journey. I aim to show my growth since the ‘Wish’ tour and deliver my best performances yet.”
        Known both for her vibrant voice and her mysterious identity, Ado has captured hearts in Japan and global audiences alike. Her vocals can be heard coloring the soundtracks of SPY x FAMILY and ONE PIECE FILM: RED, of which “New Genesis,” the film’s title track, peaked at #1 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart and Apple Music’s Top 100: Global Chart.
